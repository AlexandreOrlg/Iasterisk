<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Iasterisk is the first corrector designed for those who wish to be discreet when they correct their text, powered by OpenAI's GPT.<br>
Its operation is very simple: it takes the text from your clipboard, corrects it, and replaces your clipboard with the corrected text. In this way, you are the only one who knows that you have corrected your text!

Here's why:
* üåê Designed with those self-conscious about their writing in mind.
* üéØ Ability to use custom prompts for more precise corrections or different tones.
* üí° Based on GPT-3.5, therefore corrects 99% of mistakes.
* üåç Works for all languages around the world.
* üá´üá∑üá¨üáß The application is available in French and English.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Supports keyboard shortcuts for faster operations.
